And while there is joy in such things, the deepest well of contentment comes from a life dedicated to creation, to understanding, to building something that will last."

But the call of the easy life is strong. The nearby coastal city of Sylvane is known for its perpetual festivals and sun-drenched beaches. The stories of carefree days and nights are alluring.
